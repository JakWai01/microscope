Yes ‚Äî great question.

Removing the **lookahead logic** from the `get_extended_set` function **can cause the algorithm to get stuck**, especially in **routing-heavy quantum circuits**, due to how **dependency chains and routing constraints** interact.

---

### üß† High-Level: Why Does the Algorithm Get Stuck?

The algorithm gets stuck because:

* It **only sees gates that are currently executable**, i.e., gates with all predecessors satisfied.
* It builds the `extended_set` from those, then tries to find a **routing solution** (SWAPs, etc.) to make them executable on the hardware.
* If **no available gates can be routed** because of hardware constraints (like coupling map), but some **upcoming gates could be routed** if we knew about them ‚Äî the algorithm **has no visibility** into those.

Without lookahead, it has:

* ‚úÖ Dependency correctness.
* ‚ùå No foresight into routing pressure.

---

### üìâ Concrete Scenario: Why This Matters

Imagine:

* Your **front layer** contains a few gates (ready to execute).
* Their **target qubits are far apart** on the physical device (SWAPs needed).
* But there are **soon-to-be-ready gates** (1 or 2 steps away) that are easier to route ‚Äî perhaps they:

  * Involve nearby qubits,
  * Require fewer SWAPs,
  * Would let the algorithm make progress more easily.

By **ignoring those upcoming gates**, the algorithm:

* Might try to force routing of the front layer gates (expensive or impossible),
* Fails to find a valid SWAP sequence (or any improvement),
* And ends up **not moving forward** in mapping.

This is often described as the algorithm becoming **"myopic"** (short-sighted).

### üß≠ What the Lookahead Did

The commented-out part in your original version:

```rust
// if succ.qubits.len() == 2 {
//     extended_set.insert(successor, ...);
// }
```

Was effectively saying:

> ‚ÄúEven if this gate isn't ready yet, it looks interesting for routing ‚Äî maybe we want to bring the involved qubits closer now.‚Äù

This:

* Increases routing flexibility,
* Helps build **longer-term plans** (by choosing SWAPs that help both current and near-future gates),
* And often prevents the "stuck" scenario where nothing looks good from the narrow, immediate perspective.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Side Note on Performance

The cost is:

* Slightly more complexity (more gates to consider),
* Possibly higher computation time per iteration,
* But vastly better behavior in deeper or denser circuits.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

**Without lookahead**, the algorithm only considers gates that are ready **right now**, which:

* Restricts flexibility,
* Can lead to dead ends if routing those is hard,
* Prevents proactive optimization.

**With lookahead**, you preemptively consider soon-available gates, giving the algorithm a **global, forward-looking view** that helps it:

* Avoid getting stuck,
* Make smarter routing/SWAP decisions.

Would you like suggestions for **safe heuristics** to selectively re-enable lookahead (e.g. only if depth ‚â§ 2 or gate distance ‚â§ 4)?
