Yes — absolutely! There are several alternative strategies to populate the **extended set** beyond just traversing successors with heuristics. Each alternative gives you a different tradeoff between **aggressiveness**, **computation time**, and **solution quality**. Let’s break it down.

---

## ✅ 1. **Breadth-First Successor Expansion with Depth Cutoff**

Instead of just adding immediate or near-ready successors, perform a **breadth-first search** over the DAG and include all 2-qubit nodes up to a maximum **DAG depth** `d`.

### ✨ Benefits:

* Simple and fast to implement.
* Includes "soon-to-be-relevant" gates regardless of `required_predecessors` count.

### 🔧 Parameters:

* `max_dag_depth = 2` (for example)

```rust
if succ.qubits.len() == 2 && self.dag.depth(successor) - self.dag.depth(node_id) <= max_dag_depth {
    ...
}
```

> You may need to maintain a `depth_map[node_id]` if your DAG doesn’t expose depth directly.

---

## ✅ 2. **Priority-Based Selection Using Topological Distance + Layout Distance**

Build a **priority queue** of candidate 2-qubit gates based on a combined score:

* `score = α * logical_depth + β * layout_distance`
* Then, pick top-N entries to fill `extended_set`.

### 🧠 Logic:

This gives you the gates that are both:

* Close in the circuit (logically),
* And easy to route soon (physically).

> Use this if you want maximum routing awareness.

---

## ✅ 3. **Fanout-Weighted Lookahead**

Prioritize adding gates whose **qubits have many future uses**.

### Example heuristic:

```rust
let fanout = self.adjacency_list[&succ.qubits[0]].len()
           + self.adjacency_list[&succ.qubits[1]].len();

if fanout >= threshold {
    extended_set.insert(...);
}
```

> This helps pull in "important" gates that block more of the DAG if deferred.

---

## ✅ 4. **Use a Sliding Window Over DAG Levels**

Instead of traversing by successors, define a **window** (e.g. 2 DAG levels ahead), and include all **2-qubit gates** in that window.

### Steps:

* Run a topological sort of your DAG.
* Keep a window of size `w` starting after the front layer.
* Pull 2-qubit gates from that window.

This is more structured and can be tuned precisely with `w`.

---

## ✅ 5. **Qubit-Aware Path Expansion**

Use physical layout to expand not by DAG successors, but by **qubit neighborhoods**.

For each gate in the front layer:

* Find gates later in the DAG that share a **qubit** with the gate.
* If that gate is not too far logically, add it.

This leverages qubit-locality rather than DAG-locality.

---

## ✅ 6. **Machine Learning–Guided Lookahead** (Advanced)

If you're working on large circuits frequently:

* Train a model to predict which gates will become bottlenecks.
* Use model confidence to guide extended set inclusion.

This is powerful, but probably overkill unless you're building a research compiler.
